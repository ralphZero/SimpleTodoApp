## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Building this app was an interesting experience. It allowed me to add more structure to the way I code.
The most difficult challenge I encountered was with the design, precisely with adjusting the EditText and the Button with the ListView.
I ended up using two RelativeLayouts, one to hold the Listview and the other RelativeLayout which holds the EditText and the Button.
